The main purpose the application was to provide a detailed information regarding the weekly weather forecast. This app required me to collect information 
such as the maximum temperature, the minimum temperature, weather conditions and the day on which these were recorded.   For my app, I needed to have 3 screens,
a splash screen with my app name, logo my personal name and student number. In my slash screen, I added a exit button along with a next button to go to the main screen.
Then for my main screen, I was required to attain the weather information, so I used 4 edit text boxes to get the day, the maximum temperature, the minimum temperature 
and the weather conditions. I also added a preview screen to ensure that the user had provided the correct information along with a detail button to go to the detail screen. 
Finally, in the detail view scree,I was displayed the weather information in a table layout under their respective heading along with the back button to go back to the main screen.
